quest11_d1_a: Intrinsic motivation values are low, which means low commitment to practice and lack of enjoyment of the activity. This athlete is likely to avoid new or difficult tasks in practice, and may have a hard time focusing on his or her weaknesses.
quest11_d1_b: Intrinsic motivation values are at a medium level, which means that he is involved in practice, but could be more committed. This athlete experiences some satisfaction when tackling difficult tasks, particularly in practice, and can focus on his or her weaknesses.

This athlete experiences high satisfaction when facing difficult tasks, both in practice and in competition, attempts things that he or she had not done before and focuses on improving his or her weaknesses.
quest11_d2_a: Low levels of integrated regulation imply low levels of agreement with his core principles, far from being true to him or herself. This athlete probably doubts whether sport is an integral part of his or her life and consistent with his/her core essence.
quest11_d2_b: The obtained levels of integrated regulation imply a certain degree of agreement with the athlete’s basic principles, aligned with a sense of being true to him or herself. Sport for this athlete is a central part of his/her life and reflects his/her core essence.
quest11_d2_c: The high level of integrated regulation means high degree of agreement with the athlete’s basic principles and the feeling of being really tru to him or herself. Sport is a central part of this athlete’s life, clearly reflecting hi/her essence.
quest11_d3_a: Low values of identified motivation regulation result in this athlete thinking twice about whether sport participation allows him or her enough social interaction and enough of a chance to stay in touch with friends. He/she likely doubts that sport will promote personal development opportunities that will transfer to other areas of his/her life.
quest11_d3_b: Medium level of identified motivation regulation means that the athlete believes that participation in this sport will allow him or her to meet people and keep in touch with friends. He/she is also likely to think that this activity may result in personal development opportunities applicable to other areas of life.
quest11_d3_c: High levels of identified motivation regulation reinforce the idea that practicing this sport will allow this athlete to meet people and keep good relationships with his friends. He/she is also likely to think that this activity offers excellent opportunities for personal development, which will be helpful in other areas of life.
quest11_d4_a: The low value obtained in introjected regulation indicates that this athlete believes sport in part helps him or her stay in shape, which gives him or her a certain degree of satisfaction, venthough he probably thinks that there are more important reasons.
quest11_d4_b: The obtained value of introjected regulation is associated with the need to practice sport to remain in shape, which makes him/her feel good about him or herself. At the same time this athlete feels bad at times, because he/she considers training like an obligation.
quest11_d4_c: The high value of introjected regulation obtained is associated with a strong need to train to remain in shape, which makes the athlete feel good about him or herself, but it also results in feeling that sport is an obligation, so that he/she feels guilty when he/she misses practice.
quest11_d5_a: Low levels of extrinsic motivation mean that this athlete does not feel a need to show others how good he/she is to gain status and be admired by friends. Is able to put in relative terms the value that hers/his physical ability has for others.
quest11_d5_b: The obtained level of extrinsic motivation points to the likelihood of this athlete believing that showing how good he/she is will contribute to having prestige and being admired by his/her friends. This athlete is also likely to believe that being in good physical shape is also somewhat important to others.
quest11_d5_c: The obtained high level of extrinsic motivation points to this athlete believing that showing how good he/she is will contribute to having prestige and being admired by his/her friends. This athlete is also likely to believe that being in good physical shape is also important to others.

quest11_d6_c: The high value obtained implies that this athlete is seriously considering abandoning the sport because he/she feels incapable of reaching the desired goals.
quest11_header: Pourquoi pratiquez-vous votre sport ?
quest11_intro: Using l'échelle ci-dessous, indiquer s'il vous plaît dans quelle mesure chacun des articles suivants correspond à une des raisons pour lesquelles vous pratiquez actuellement votre sport.
quest11_label_0: Self-determinated Motivation
quest11_label_1: Intrinsic Motivation
quest11_label_2: Integrated regulation
quest11_label_3: Identified regulation
quest11_label_4: Introjected regulation
quest11_label_5: Extrinsic Motivation
quest11_label_6: Amotivación
quest11_val_10: The high value obtained in Amotivation contaminates the rest of the measures, which annuls the possibility to make any more complex or significant interpretations. Consultation with the tutor is required because this athlete is in a worrisome situation, feels incapable of achieving success and is experiencing a noticeable decrease in self-confidence. The athlete’s continuity in sport is in danger, given the level of confusion and perceived inefficacy to reach the desired goals in sport.
quest11_val_1: High values of intrinsic motivation dimensions go hand in hand with low values in the extrinsic dimensions. Besides the other spects already discussed, this means that this athlete’s high levels of self-determined motivation will help maintain a high sense of efficacy in his/her actions, will strengthen the perseverance in his/her goals, will favor the use of positive coping styles and will have a positive impact in his/her personal adjustment with increased feelings of wellness.
quest11_val_2: High Intrinsic Motivation values are accompanied by medium level values in Extrinsic Motivation. That implies that this athlete’s high levels of self-determined motivation will help maintain a high sense of efficacy in his/her actions, will strengthen the perseverance in his/her goals, will favor the use of positive coping styles and will have a positive impact in his/her personal adjustment , with increased feelings of wellness. At the same time it will be important to monitor the extrinsic motivation values because they can undermine the positive motivational state described, particularly if this evaluation has been conducted outside of the competitive season. 
quest11_val_3: High values of all the dimensions measured were obtained. This represents a confusing and contradictory motivational state, because his/her values pool around two opposite ends of the spectrum; self-determination and externally determined. It may be necessary to consult the tutor, unless lo que sigue me parece una contradiccion. Lo puedes revisar Josean?Se hace necesario consultar con el/la tutor/a, salvo que los valores de la amotivación sean muy bajos y nos encontremos en periodo competitivo, en cuyo caso esta sugerencia sería recomendable. It is also recommended to continue monitoring and conduct another evaluation shortly.
quest11_val_4: Medium level values of self-regulated motivational dimensions, accompanied by low values of the externally determined values. This means that, in the one hand, the level of intrinsic motivation may help maintain high level of efficacy in his or her behaviors, and a certain level of perseverance in reaching for goals, with a generally positive coping style and frequent feelings of wellness. The low values of extrinsic motivation obtained can be seen as a positive, because they act as an antidote against low commitment in difficult situations or feelings of chronic fatigue, particularly if this athlete is not in season. It is recommended to strengthen and increase intrinsic motivation levels.
quest11_val_5: Medium level values of both, intrinsic motivation dimensions and externally controlled dimensions. This implies that, in the one hand, the level of intrinsic motivation may help maintain high level of efficacy in his or her behaviors, and a certain level of perseverance in reaching for goals. It is important to monitor the extrinsic motivation values, particularly in the short term, to counter the negative impact that they may have in pressure situations. It is recommended to consult with the tutor to set up a mini-intervention focused on raising intrinsic motivation values.
quest11_val_6: Medium level values of self-regulated motivational dimensions, accompanied by high values of the externally determined values . This pattern implies that, although the intrinsic motivational values will help maintain high efficacy in his/her actions, goal perseverance and positive coping styles will be weakened. At the same time, high extrinsic values will interfere with the capacity to reach the necessary motivational level required to feel the personal balance needed for optimal performance. Consultation with the tutor is recommended to regain emotional balance and implement the needed interventions to strengthen perseverance and continuity.
quest11_val_7: Low levels of both, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation values. Even though this athlete lacks the motivational energy to maintain high levels of efficacy in his/her actions and goal perseverance, the lack of dependency of external contingencies may have a positive impact. Perhaps this is due to the athlete being in the midst of a high intensity training cycle or working at many and very complex tasks. Keeping the extrinsic values low will be important , particularly during the competitive season, to avoid fear of mistakes or excess pressure. This situation requires consultation with the tutor to implement as soon as possible a strategy designed to increase intrinsic motivation values while keeping the extrinsic ones low.
quest11_val_8: Low self-determined motivational values and medium levels of extrinsic motivation. This athlete lacks the motivational energy to maintain high levels of efficacy and goal perseverance, which will negatively impact his/her coping styles. The short term behavior of the extrinsic motivation dimensions should be monitored to counter the possible lack of motivation (amotivation) or the negative impact of external pressure sources (extrinsic motivation). This situation requires consultation with the tutor to implement as soon as possible a strategy designed to increase intrinsic motivation values while keeping the extrinsic ones stable or lower.
quest11_val_9: Low self-determined motivational values and high levels of extrinsic motivation. This athlete lacks the motivational energy to maintain high levels of efficacy and goal perseverance, which will negatively impact his/her coping styles. The high values obtained in the extrinsic dimensions (particularly amotivation) imply that he/she is excessively dependent on external contingency sources. This situation requires consultation with the tutor to implement as soon as possible a strategy designed to increase intrinsic motivation values while keeping the extrinsic ones stable or lower, otherwise the continuity of sport participation may be compromised.

Il a des problèmes pour valoriser positivement les améliorations des deportistes et quand ils doivent faire face aux situations nouvelles ou avec une grande difficulté ils vont se sentir malalaises sans initiative. Il faudra orienter le technicien pour qu´il valorisé l´importance des améliorations qui se produisent a travers l´autocomparation du deportiste.
quest12_d2_b: Le climat motivationnel de maîtrise se trouve dans des niveaux moyens, ce qui est correct mais peu s´améliorer. Il faut mettre en valeur les améliorations des deportistes ce qui les aide à affronter avec une bonne attitude les situations nouvelles ou avec une grande difficulté. Il sera nécessaire de les rappeler sur l´importance qui ont les améliorations pour que les deportistes réussissent ses buts, en reconnaissant et en valorisant son effort quant on produit une amélioration personnel bien qu´elle soit petite.

quest1_63: I reach a goal
quest1_64: I am clearly superior
quest1_65: To what extent?
quest1_d10_a: The very low degree of confidence in his or her goals observed will make reaching them very difficult, because it is an insufficient and unstable level and will provoke many doubts about his or her skills. It will be important to monitor the levels of anxiety of the athlete, and if they are high, the tutor must be consulted to plan a joint general restructuration program.
quest1_d10_b: This medium level of confidence in his or her goals observed will result in diminished chances of reaching them. If this is accompanied by unstable estimations, it indicates an insufficient and unstable Degree of Confidence, and it will be difficult to feel capable to cope with any challenges that may present themselves. It is recommended to conduct 3 or 4 sessions towards improving this important area, using the Self-Efficacy PDF. 
quest1_d10_c: Such a high degree of confidence in his or her goals, if it also includes stability in the estimations, means a high conviction in his or her capacity to reach them. This high degree in belief in oneself has an overall positive impact and it will generate extra positive energy. In other words, the Degree of Confidence is high and stable, with good feelings in competition and a high capacity to cope with any challenges that may present themselves. It will be important to monitor if these values fluctuate according to the Degree of Perceived Difficulty and if so, it would be important to discuss it with the tutor.
quest1_d11_a: The obtained degree of usage of techniques or strategies related to self-control is low. It is possible that in his or her preparation there has been no need to address it until now, maybe because of good emotional equilibrium. It may be helpful in any case to encourage him or her to learn some relaxation techniques.
quest1_d11_b: The obtained value is at a medium level, which means that, at times, the athlete dedicates part of his or her preparation to develop self-control skills, which is positive. It is important to maintain and strengthen this work if it is still insufficient. 
quest1_d11_c: The high value obtained indicates that the athlete is familiar with relaxation techniques and has good self-control skills. The only requirement is to remain vigilant about the tasks done during the season in order to maintain and reinforce this very important skill.
quest1_d12_a: We see low values in terms of use of visualization techniques and strategies. This also indicates some difficulties for imagery training. It would be helpful to watch materials related to the sport and then try to visualize them. Little by little he or she can practice imagery without the support of video material.
quest1_d12_b: The obtained values are at a medium level in terms of visualization techniques and strategies usage. That means that there is room for improvement in this area. It would be important to combine watching videos of his or her own performance with visualization practice without the help of video. It may also be helpful to ask the athlete to keep track of sport related dreams he or she may have.
quest1_d12_c: The high values obtained in visualization techniques and strategies usage indicate an unusual ability, which must be exploited to the max. It may be helpful to encourage the athlete to dream with moments of the competition, enjoy them and remember them with total vividness.
quest1_d13_a: The low score obtained indicates a lack of personal actions for self-motivation, and a lack of preparation routines, which implies that the athlete ignores the importance of anticipation actions and competition plans for performance. It is necessary to educate the athlete and provide instruction in how to organize a holistic competition plan. 
quest1_d13_b: An average value such as the one obtained indicates that the athlete sometimes takes some actions related to self-motivation and also to certain preparation routines, which is positive. It would be useful to enquire about the holistic competition plan and provide instruction on how to improve it.
quest1_d13_c: The high value obtained indicates that the athlete engages in personal self-motivation actions and in specific preparation routines, which is positive. It is important to revise and adjust the plan periodically.
quest1_d14_a: The low value associated with EGO motivational orientation, means that for this athlete the obtained results are not very important, probably less than the improvement in skills, which will result in high commitment during practice and will help with fear of failure control, if that were present.
quest1_d14_b: The medium value obtained in EGO motivational orientation,implies that the performance results are important for this athlete and, if they are similar to the Task motivational orientation, will provide good motivation to increase the commitment to effort, helping control fear of failure if that were present.
quest1_d14_c: The high value associated with EGO motivational orientation, means that for this athlete the obtained results have the most value. Only if they are accompanied by high Task motivational orientation values will that result in good motivation to increase effort and commitment. If Ego motivation is higher than Task, it may negatively impact the athlete’s capacity to cope with maximum personal challenge situations.
quest1_d15_a: The Task motivational orientation is low, which is worrisome. It is hard for this athlete to positively value his or her own improvements and in new or very difficult situations he or she may withdraw some and need a little push. It may be important to monitor his or her attendance and consistency in practice, reminding and reinforcing the importance of continued attendance and of personal improvements, using self-comparison. 
quest1_d15_b: The Task motivational orientation is at a medium level. This athlete likely values positively his or her own improvements and copes well with new or very difficult situations. It is important to reinforce his or her commitment to effort, highlighting the importance of improvements to reach one’s goals. His or her effort must be recognized and valued every time there is a personal improvement, no matter how small. This way we may increase this value.
quest1_d15_c: The athlete’s Task motivational orientation is high, which is positive. This athlete focuses on his or her own improvements and approaches new and very difficult situations with a great attitude. He or she has great commitment to practice, high perceived competency and understands that mistakes are improvement tools. 
quest1_d1_a: The values of Tension are low, which is positive, and implies that this athlete is calm and focused on whatever task has been assigned.
quest1_d1_b: The Tension values are at a medium level, which may cause some concern in this case. It is important to monitor the evolution of this dimension in the next days and attempt to redirect it to a lower level, particularly if competition is still a ways away.
quest1_d1_c: Tension levels are high, which is worrisome, because this athlete will probably be unable to focus on his or her work until the levels are lowered. It may be due to the proximity of a competition, but if that is not the case, it has to be monitored closely.
quest1_d2_a: Depression values are low, which is good, implying that this athlete feels supported and appreciated, conveying good balance and focus during practice sessions.
quest1_d2_b: Depression levels are at a medium level, which causes some concern. This type of response is often due to general malaise and it impacts the practice dynamics. The evolution of this dimension must be monitored in the following days and attempts should be made to reduce it and lower its level, because it can negatively impact the other values, particularly Hostility and Tension.
quest1_d2_c: Depression values are high, and that is alarming, because it is possible that this athlete’s situation is quite complicated. There may be elements external to athletics that may be negatively impacting his or her mood. It is important to prevent that it contaminates the other negative dimensions, particularly Hostility and Tension. The athlete’s overall well being is a concern.
quest1_d3_a: Hostility levels are low, which is positive, implicating that this athlete feels content and satisfied with the way things are evolving, and remains focused on training.
quest1_d3_b: Hostility values are at a medium level, perhaps because the athlete is a bit irritated with some practice issues, but it does not impact his performance very much. These values may also be associated to aches and pains of minor injuries. In some cases these values represent an extra level of energy which is helpful to tolerate training loads, if the athlete can redirect them positively. 
quest1_d3_c: Hostility values are high, and that is alarming, because the athlete is likely to be very unhappy and disgusted with the way things are going. Mild injuries or aches and pains may be associated with it. It is important to minimize the contagion effect that this can have over the rest of the negative dimensions. If these values coincide with high Depression levels it could be a dangerous situation.
quest1_d4_a: Vigor levels are low, which is negative and worrisome, because it implies that this athlete is in the doldrums. It may be due to a minor injury or aches and pains. If these values are opposed to Fatigue values, and there are also high scores in Hostility and/or Tension, we may be facing an overtraining syndrome. In any case, the causes must be explored and, if at all possible, rest for a few days and recover optimal levels.
quest1_d4_b: Vigor levels are at a medium range, which is within normal limits, particularly if they are in the high end of medium. It is possible that these values are recorded after a particularly hard practice session. If the values of Hostility and Depression are also medium high, the situation will have to be monitored to prevent a contamination effect. 
quest1_d4_c: Vigor levels are high, in the optimal performance zone, great to cope with any challenge. It is a great indicator which, in principle, guaranties good emotional balance.
quest1_d5_a: Fatigue levels are low, which is positive and implies that this athlete feels energetic, with a good attitude to work hard in practice and tolerate high loads and high intensity of effort. 
quest1_d5_b: Fatigue levels are at a medium level, which is a cause for some concern, unless the data were collected right after a high effort or a practice session. It may also be due to being in a high intensity training phase. If these values are accompanied by a good recovery process we can consider them normal.
quest1_d5_c: Fatigue levels are high, which is worrisome because it may signify an overtraining syndrome, particularly if Vigor levels are low, except if the data have been collected after a practice session. These values may also have been contaminated by high values in Depression and Hostility, which would paint a very alarming emotional picture.
quest1_d6_a: There is a low level of cognitive anxiety, conveying calm and serenity, free of worry, able to focus when needed.
quest1_d6_b: Cognitive anxiety is at a medium level, which implies that sometimes this athlete is uneasy, nervous. It is recommended to do some specific work in this area, reinforced with the for stress/pressure material until it is at a lower level, under 48.
quest1_d6_c: High levels of cognitive anxiety, with excessive worry about personal performance during competition. Disorganized thoughts may be present, making it impossible to concentrate when needed. A specific intervention must be conducted to reduce this high value, reviewing the stress/pressure contents. If these values remain high, the tutor must be contacted. 
quest1_d7_a: Self-confidence values are very low, provoking a lot of insecurity during the competition, particularly under pressure situations. It is important to set up a specific plan to increase these values. It is recommended to review the self-efficacy materials, with a session with the coach or the tutor. 
quest1_d7_b: Self-confidence is at a medium level, showing some uneasiness in pressure situations. It may be that it is hard for this athlete to see himself or herself successfully coping with competition situations. It is recommended to conduct a specific intervention to improve these values until they are higher, above 60. 
quest1_d7_c: Self-confidence is high, with good competitive feelings, comfortable and with high capacity to optimize performance in pressure situations.
quest1_d8_a: Low somatic anxiety levels, conveying calm and comfort, with good ability to physically relax and remain mentally active when needed, that is, alert calm.
quest1_d8_b: Medium levels of somatic anxiety, which means that this athlete is a bit tense and restless. We recommend using part of practice to lowering and improving these levels, and reinforcing that with a revision of the Relaxation material.
quest1_d8_c: Somatic anxiety values are too high and interfere with practice. This athlete will have a hard time controlling tension and he or she may act impulsively, which will interfere with optimal performance. To lower these values the athlete needs a specific intervention, reinforced with the Relaxation and Stress/Pressure material and counseling from the tutor. 
quest1_d9_a: The estimate of perceived difficulty is directly related to probabilities of success. The lower the difficulty of the proposed goal, the higher the likelihood of achieving it. It is important that at least two of the goals be associated to personal improvement outcomes. These low values of the estimate of perceived difficulty mean a selection of easy goals. If the evaluation is inconsistent it means that the athlete can discriminate when choosing goals, but his or her self-confidence is probably low. The recommended intervention includes consulting the Self-efficacy materials.
quest1_d9_b: The estimate of perceived difficulty is directly related to probabilities of success. The lower the difficulty of the proposed goal, the higher the likelihood of achieving it. It is important that at least two of the goals be associated to personal improvement outcomes. The medium level values of the estimate of perceived difficulty imply a limited selection of goals. If the evaluation is somewhat consistent, around 70, it means that this athlete has a tendency to moderate self-selected goals, but should be more ambitious. The athlete cannot change the degree of difficulty of the situations, but can increase the probabilities of success by maintaining high levels of self-belief. 
quest1_d9_c: The estimate of perceived difficulty is directly related to probabilities of success. The lower the difficulty of the proposed goal, the higher the likelihood of achieving it. It is important that at least two of the goals be associated to personal improvement outcomes. The high values obtained of estimate of perceived difficulty mean a self-selection of ambitious goals for the season. If there is a degree of variability in the evaluation, between 70-100, it means that this athlete has a great capacity to discriminate when choosing goals. The athlete cannot change the degree of difficulty of the situations, but can increase the probabilities of success by maintaining high levels of self-belief.

quest2_label_8: Évaluation générale
quest2_label_9: réponse 
quest2_val_1: En général le niveau de tolérance présente des valeurs moyens très positifs ce qui va le permettre d´affronter n´importe quelle situation d´entraînement ou de compétition de forme optimal. Le niveau des générateurs est dans son ensemble dans des valeurs baisses tandis que les valeurs des dimensions récupératrices sont positifs, surtout ceux qu´on vienne de signaler. Pourtant on peut signaler que ce deportiste à une perception élevé sur son état de forme et ses prestations de rendement il se trouve très motivé et avec une grande détermination pour réussir ses buts.
quest2_val_2: En général le niveau de tolérance présente des valeurs moyens très positifs ce qui faite qu´il possède des ressources pour entamer des situations spéciales dans l´entraînement et dans la compétition. Le niveau des générateurs est dans son ensemble dans des valeurs élevé dans la partie baisses tandis que les valeurs des dimensions récupératrices sont situés dans la partie haute du niveau moyen c´est à dire 4, comme on vient de signaler. On peut signaler aussi que ce deportiste possède une correcte perception en ce qui concerne son état de forme et ses prestations de rendements ; il se trouve motivé et avec beaucoup d´envie de réussir ses buts.
quest2_val_3: En général le niveau de tolérance se trouve dans une situation délicate car il existe une égalité parmi les valeurs générateurs et récupérateurs ce qui nous mène a une situation d´alarme mais avec des ressources suffisantes pour l´affronter et essayer de réduire le niveau d´estress généré par les dimensions signalés. C´est important de envisager un plan de travail spécifique appuyé sur des contenues qui ont relation avec la Pression/Estrées et en plus, l´implémenter avec une exploration presentiel au deportiste pour contrôler une possible cause d´estress et pouvoir l´aborder correctement.
quest2_val_4: En général le niveau de tolérance se trouve dans des niveaux très baisses car le niveau des valeurs moyens qui correspond aux générateurs sont plus grandes que les récupérateurs. Il s´agit d´une situation de risque qui demande être abordé tout de suite avec le conseil du tuteur quoique après la réflexion entraîneur deportiste puisse identifier les causes qui ont généré les valeurs signales. Dans ce cas la on peut proposer un travail spécifique appuyé sur les contenus qui sont en relation avec la Pression/estrés et avec l´orientation indirecte du tuteur.

quest3_d1_a: Tension values are at a low level, which is positive, and implies that this athlete is calm and focused on whatever task has been assigned 
quest3_d1_b: The Tension values are at a medium level, which may cause some concern in this case. It is important to monitor the evolution of this dimension in the next days and attempt to redirect it to a lower level, particularly if competition is still a ways away.
quest3_d1_c: Tension levels are high, which is worrisome, because this athlete will probably be unable to focus on his or her work until the levels are lowered. It may be due to the proximity of a competition, but if that is not the case, it has to be monitored closely
quest3_d2_a: Depression values are low, which is good, implying that this athlete feels supported and appreciated, conveying good balance and focus during practice sessions.
quest3_d2_b: Depression levels are at a medium level, which causes some concern. This type of response is often due to general malaise and it impacts the practice dynamics. The evolution of this dimension must be monitored in the following days and attempts should be made to reduce it and lower its level, because it can negatively impact the other values, particularly Hostility and Tension.
quest3_d2_c: Depression values are high, and that is alarming, because it is possible that this athlete’s situation is quite complicated. There may be elements external to athletics that may be negatively impacting his or her mood. It is important to prevent that it contaminates the other negative dimensions, particularly Hostility and Tension. The athlete’s overall well being is a concern.
quest3_d3_a: Hostility levels are low, which is positive, implicating that this athlete feels content and satisfied with the way things are evolving, and remains focused on training
quest3_d3_b: Hostility values are at a medium level, perhaps because the athlete is a bit with some practice issues, but it does not impact his performance very much. These values may also be associated to aches and pains of minor injuries. In some cases these values represent an extra level of energy which is helpful to tolerate training loads, if the athlete can redirect them positively.
quest3_d3_c: Hostility values are high, and that is alarming, because the athlete is likely to be very unhappy and disgusted with the way things are going. Mild injuries or aches and pains may be associated with it. It is important to minimize the contagion effect that this can have over the rest of the negative dimensions. If these values coincide with high Depression levels it could be a dangerous situation.
quest3_d4_a: Vigor levels are low, which is negative and worrisome, because it implies that this athlete is in the doldrums. It may be due to a minor injury or aches and pains. If these values are opposed to Fatigue values, and there are also high scores in Hostility and/or Tension, we may be facing an overtraining syndrome. In any case, the causes must be explored and, if at all possible, rest for a few days and recover optimal levels.
quest3_d4_b: Vigor levels are at a medium range, which is within normal limits, particularly if they are in the high end of medium. It is possible that these values are recorded after a particularly hard practice session. If the values of Hostility and Depression are also medium high, the situation will have to be monitored to prevent a contamination effect.
quest3_d4_c: Vigor levels are high, in the optimal performance zone, great to cope with any challenge. It is a great indicator which, in principle, guaranties good emotional balance.
quest3_d5_a: Fatigue levels are low, which is positive and implies that this athlete feels energetic, with a good attitude to work hard in practice and tolerate high loads and high intensity of effort.
quest3_d5_b: Fatigue levels are at a medium level, which is a cause for some concern, unless the data were collected right after a high effort or a practice session. It may also be due to being in a high intensity training phase. If these values are accompanied by a good recovery process we can consider them normal
quest3_d5_c: Fatigue levels are high, which is worrisome because it may signify an overtraining syndrome, particularly if Vigor levels are low, except if the data have been collected after a practice session. These values may also have been contaminated by high values in Depression and Hostility, which would paint a very alarming emotional picture.
quest3_d6_a: There are low values of commitment to practice. It is probably hard for this athlete to focus on his work and his response could be better when faced with maximum demand situations. The athlete’s level of commitment is lower on tasks he or she does not master than on favorable situations. Two other dimensions, perceived competency and anxiety, must be considered when evaluating motivational level.
quest3_d6_b: The values for commitment to practice are at a medium level, with considerable implication in the proposed tasks. When things get tough the athlete loses ground, but in general shows good commitment and dedication to the tasks proposed. 
quest3_d6_c: High level of commitment to practice, which implies high level of attention to the explanations and indications of the coach or teammates. Even when tasks are very difficult this athlete maintains the level of interest and perseverates motivated to do the best job possible, regardless of the demands being made.
quest3_d7_a: This athlete shows low levels of fear of failure, remaining calm, not worrying about making mistakes, and when that happens he or she thinks of it as a learning opportunity. 
quest3_d7_b: This athlete shows signs of nervousness when facing tasks where he or she may make mistakes, worrying about errors, particularly in tasks he or she does not master. When he has a hard time in practice this athlete is likely to think too much and get upset.
quest3_d7_c: High levels of fear of failure, showing a lot of nervousness and worry when faced with new or complex tasks. Gives a lot of importance to making mistakes and often gets mad when making a mistake. It would be important to help the athlete see that the only ones who can make mistakes are those who try something new or hard, and that trying things is the only path to improvement. Mistakes are necessary companions in the trip towards improvement.
quest3_d8_a: Low levels of perceived competency. It is possible that this is due to the athlete making normative comparisons, that is, comparing his or her performance against that of other athletes to assess competency level. In this case, perception of one’s own skills must be reinforced, particularly in complex or hard to solve situations. The value obtained in fear of failure will be helpful to make a more precise diagnosis.
quest3_d8_b: This athlete shows good capacity to handle the tasks he faces, and has good levels of perceived competency. Even that perception could improve if the athlete is redirected to his or her own improvement. Special attention and reinforcement must be given when facing very complex or challenging tasks.
quest3_d8_c: High levels of perceived competency, with very high capacity to tackle new tasks. Always ready to give his or her best, with a sense of unlimited achievement and dominance, able to handle anything.

quest4_2: Motivation Level
quest4_3: Importance of the competition for you
quest4_4: Knowledge about your opponents
quest4_5: Is this event right for you?
quest4_6: Have you prepared the competition plan?
quest4_7: Do you have a clear idea of how you want to react?
quest4_8: Outcome you expect to achieve 
quest4_d10_a: The estimate of perceived difficulty is directly related to the probabilities of success. The lower the degree of difficulty of a goal the higher the probabilities to achieve it. It would be important that at least two of the goals be related to personal improvement goals. Low values of the estimate of perceived difficulty imply a selection of low challenge goals. If that is accompanied by an unstable evaluation pattern, it means that the athlete discriminates when choosing goals, but it is also likely to represent low self-confidence levels. It is recommended to do a specific intervention using the Self-Efficacy materials. 
quest4_d10_b: The estimate of perceived difficulty is directly related to the probabilities of success. The lower the degree of difficulty of a goal the higher the probabilities to achieve it. It would be important that at least two of the goals be related to personal improvement goals. Medium level values of the estimate of perceived difficulty imply a limited goal selection. If the evaluation pattern is stable, it means that the athlete tends to choose uniform goals, but should be more ambitious. It must be remembered that the degree of difficulty of the situations is not under the athlete’s control and it is something that cannot be changed. At the same time, keeping a high level of self-belief increases one’s chances of success.
quest4_d10_c: The estimate of perceived difficulty is directly related to the probabilities of success. The lower the degree of difficulty of a goal the higher the probabilities to achieve it. It would be important that at least two of the goals be related to personal improvement goals. The high values obtained in estimate of perceived difficulty imply the setting of ambitious goals for the season. If they are accompanied by a certain degree of variability in the pattern of estimation, it means that the athlete has an excellent capacity to discriminate when choosing goals. The estimate of perceived difficulty is directly related to the probabilities of success. The lower the degree of difficulty of a goal the higher the probabilities to achieve it. It would be important that at least two of the goals be related to personal improvement goals.
quest4_d11_a: Perceived self-efficacy values are low, which means high degree of insecurity when faced with high competitive situations. It is necessary to raise these values before facing new competition settings. It is recommended to integrate a mini-strategy within the holistic competition plan, specifically in self-efficacy towards future competitions. At about the half-way point try to increase the values with the help of the tutor, using verbal persuasion and visualization of past successes. 
quest4_d11_b: Perceived self-efficacy values are at medium levels, which imply a certain degree of insecurity during the competition. It may be due to the impact of the estimate of perceived difficulty, or it can be due to being still far from competition shape. In any case, it is recommended to use verbal persuasion and visualization of past successes to increase these values. If that does not work, the tutor should be consulted. 
quest4_d11_c: Perceived self-efficacy is at a high level, with good attitude in front of the competition and commitment to applying it during the contest. These are optimal levels which increase the capacity to perform right now as they approach the maximum.
quest4_d12_a: The evaluation of preparation of an integral competition plan is low, which lowers the athlete’s possibilities of achievement. It is highly likely that the emotional response is determined by the negative dimensions of the mood state, and it is also likely that the confidence is unstable. A specific intervention is recommended, using the contents of the Personal Competition Plan, Self-Efficacy and Responsibility/Guilt materials and the tutor’s help. 
quest4_d12_b: The evaluation of preparation of an integral competition plan is at a medium level. Perhaps the athlete has a hard time controlling negative emotional responses and that causes an increase in self-doubt. An intervention should focus on emotionally restructuring the personal competition plan and visualizing it. This aspect must be considered when conducting Performance Evaluation.
quest4_d12_c: The evaluation of preparation of an integral competition plan is at optimal levels. That should positively impact the emotional control of negative dimensions and it will also reinforce the degree of confidence. It may also contribute to a better overall Performance Evaluation. 
quest4_d1_a: Tension values are low, indicating that the athlete is calm. It must be assessed whether this level is actually helpful in the current competition setting, because it is usually recommended to reach medium levels in order to cope with maximum performance challenges.
quest4_d1_b: Tension values are at a medium level, which is positive because it means the athlete is alert and ready. In competition settings medium level values are considered optimal.
quest4_d1_c: Tension values are high, which can have a negative impact on the athlete’s performance. Being too nervous and worried, it is unlikely that the athlete was able to focus on the task at hand during the competition.
quest4_d2_a: Depression values are low, which is positive. It means that the athlete feels supported and valued, carrying good feelings and emotional balance to the competition.
quest4_d2_b: Depression values are at a medium level, which causes some concern. It may be due to general malaise, which can impact the competition dynamics. It is important to monitor the evolution of this dimension and analyze its causes in order to modify it for the next competition.
quest4_d2_c: Depression values are high, which is alarming. It is likely that the competition did not go well. It is necessary to identify the elements that are negatively impacting the athlete’s mood.
quest4_d3_a: Hostility levels are low, which may not be very helpful. It must be assessed whether these values are helpful because in general optimal performance is achieved with values at a medium level.
quest4_d3_b: Hostility is at a medium level, which is often considered optimal for this competition situation. These values often translate into extra energy that is helpful to cope with tough situations during competition.
quest4_d3_c: Hostility values are high, which is alarming because they are likely to negatively impact the athlete’s performance. Being too mad and irritated, the athlete is unlikely to have used the energy in a smart way, which the result of underperforming in the crucial moments. The information contained in the Activation, and Optimal Performance materials can be helpful here.
quest4_d4_a: Vigor values are low, which means the athlete is in the doldrums when reaching the competition. If fatigue is high we may have an overtraining situation. In any case, at the end of the competition, it is recommended to take several days off and get back to desirable levels before resuming practice.
quest4_d4_b: Vigor values are at a medium level, which can hurt the athlete’s performance, unless the value is medium-high. Possible reasons are lack of specific preparation for this competition, or being in a very intense training period.
quest4_d4_c: Vigor values are high, in the optimal zone for competition, which increases the probabilities of success in front of any challenge. The positive emotional energy suggests good emotional balance when faced with the competition. 
quest4_d5_a: Fatigue levels are low, which is positive, indicating that this athlete feels energetic and able to tolerate the competition pace and the demands of long term efforts during competition.
quest4_d5_b: Fatigue levels are at a medium level, which can be worrisome because it may negatively impact performance. If these values were obtained during the competition, they can be considered within normal limits and in order to evaluate them we need to also observe the recovery process.
quest4_d5_c: Fatigue levels are high, which is alarming because it will negatively impact the athlete’s performance, unless it is due to lack of preparation for this competition and coincides with high volume and intensity in practice. If the taper process was correct, high values such as this one may indicate overtraining danger in this athlete. 
quest4_d6_a: Low values of cognitive anxiety, implying calm and balance, lack of worry, with capacity to focus on the right things during competition.
quest4_d6_b: Cognitive anxiety is at a medium level, which means the athlete is, at times, uneasy and slightly nervous. Minor adjustments should be made during the competition, using mainly verbal persuasion and also referring back to the content of pressure/stress materials in order to lower these values for the next competitions.
quest4_d6_c: Cognitive anxiety is high, with too much worry about personal performance during competition. Disorganized thoughts are likely to have interfered with concentration efforts at crucial moments. The athlete’s Competition Plan must be revised, and specific interventions must be carried out during practice, focusing on the content of the pressure/stress materials.
quest4_d7_a: Self-confidence values are low, resulting in great insecurity during the competition, particularly in pressure situations. It is necessary to focus on the personal competition plan and use verbal persuasion for the next competitions. A long term intervention requires specific work to increase these values, with visualization of personal experiences and self-efficacy work organized by the tutor. 
quest4_d7_b: Self-confidence is at a medium level, which implies certain discomfort with the performance situation. It is possible that this athlete has a hard time seeing himself successfully coping with competition demands, so verbal persuasion should be used with him or her before the next competitions. A specific plan should be outlined to modify these issues on the long run.
quest4_d7_c: High level of self-confidence, with good attitude in front of the competition, comfortable and with the ability to maximize performance in high pressure situations. The strength of this belief will allow the athlete to face competitions with the certainty of performing to the best of his or her capabilities.
quest4_d8_a: Low levels of somatic anxiety, conveying a sense of calm and comfort, with good ability to physically relax, while remaining mentally alert when needed, in a state of relaxed anticipation. These are optimal competition values.
quest4_d8_b: Medium level values of somatic anxiety mean that the athlete is somewhat tense and restless. A mini-intervention based on the Relaxation/Breathing materials would be useful here before the next competitions, altogether with the cognitive reevaluation of the personal competition plan. For the long term, it must be reinforced with visualization of successful past experiences and information from the Relaxation materials.
quest4_d8_c: Somatic anxiety values are too high and interfere with performance. The athlete will have a hard time controlling tension and he or she is likely to rush into action, which again interferes with optimal performance. It is recommended to implement a mini-intervention, with information from the Relaxation/Breathing materials, to help the athlete lower these values for the next competitions. This needs to be integrated in the personal competition plan. In the long run, this can be reinforced by visualizing previous successful experiences, and some work with the tutor on the Relaxation and Pressure/Stress materials. 
quest4_d9_a: This appears to be a competition of low significance and importance for this athlete, because the values are low. It will be necessary to focus on the Self-regulatory system and make an effort in all three dimensions; Self-control, Visualization of the personal competition plan, and Anticipation behavior. This will be a good opportunity to try hard and actively work in the search for Optimal Performance State.
quest4_d9_b: This appears to be a competition of moderate importance, with some significance in the athlete’s calendar, because the values obtained are at a medium level. It will be important to focus on self-improvement and keep in mind that participation in any competition offers an opportunity for improvement. The emotional restructuring within the personal competition plan will have to follow the same lines; direction-challenge-opportunity for improvement and anticipation of wish to compete.
quest4_d9_c: This competition appears to be very important and have great meaning for this athlete, because the obtained values are very high. It will be necessary to focus the evaluation on the positives, on the challenge, considering that the athlete has been preparing to compete, and being able to do it is already satisfactory.

quest5_d1_a: The values of Global Performance evaluation are low, which means that the technical-tactical, physical and psychological performance in competition has not been at the level of the athlete’s ability. This will impact the Evaluation of Perceived Performance, and it will be necessary to analyze in detail the most relevant actions taken during competition.
quest5_d1_b: The values of Global Performance are at a medium level, which implies a certain degree of satisfaction with the technical-tactical, physical and psychological behavior, but it is also clear that the athlete’s performance has not been as good as expected.
quest5_d1_c: The values of Global Performance are high, which implies a high degree of satisfaction with the technical-tactical, physical and psychological response, and it also contributes to a high score in the Evaluation of Perceived Performance.
quest5_d2_a: Emotional performance evaluation is low, which means that during the competition the athlete has not been able to utilize properly the emotional response. There has been no enjoyment and when pressure was high the athlete was likely feeling insecure. It seems that in spite of trying to have good emotional coping, it has not happened. If this keeps happening it will be necessary to implement a specific intervention with the tutor and the contents of the Emotions, Stress and Personal Competition Plan materials.
